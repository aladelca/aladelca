# Welcome to Coffee and Data üöÄ

Welcome to my data science realm! üëã I'm **Adrian Alarcon**, a passionate data scientist who loves transforming raw data into actionable insights. This GitHub repository serves as a playground where I experiment with cutting-edge techniques, share my projects, and showcase my journey in the world of data.


## Summary üìä

Passionate about Analytics and Machine Learning, I am eager to machine learning models to generate impact in Business KPIs. I strongly desire to pursue a career as a Data Scientist in the Consulting, Technology & Retail sectors.

As a Master of Management in Analytics student at McGill University, I am developing a unique skill set in order to improve data-driven decision-making that uses both business acumen and technical skills.
